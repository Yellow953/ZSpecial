                                            SECTION 5 - PRODUCTS OR SERVICES (if applicable)<br><br>
                                            Certain products or Services may be available exclusively online through the
                                            website. These products or Services may have limited quantities and are
                                            subject to return or exchange only according to our Refund Policy.<br>
                                            We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors
                                            and images of our products that appear at the store. We cannot guarantee
                                            that your computer monitor's display of any color will be accurate.<br>
                                            We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the sales of our
                                            products or Services to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction. We
                                            may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis. We reserve the right to
                                            limit the quantities of any products or Services that we offer. All
                                            descriptions of products or product pricing are subject to change at anytime
                                            without notice, at the sole discretion of us. We reserve the right to
                                            discontinue any product at any time. Any offer for any product or Service
                                            made on this site is void where prohibited.<br>
                                            We do not warrant that the quality of any products, Services, information,
                                            or other material purchased or obtained by you will meet your expectations,
                                            or that any errors in the Service will be corrected.<br>

                                            SECTION 6 - ACCURACY OF BILLING AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION<br><br>
                                            We reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We may, in our
                                            sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per
                                            household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or
                                            under the same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that
                                            use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event that we make a
                                            change to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the
                                            e‑mail and/or billing address/phone number provided at the time the order
                                            was made. We reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole
                                            judgment, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers or distributors.<br>

                                            You agree to provide current, complete and accurate purchase and account
                                            information for all purchases made at our store. You agree to promptly
                                            update your account and other information, including your email address and
                                            credit card numbers and expiration dates, so that we can complete your
                                            transactions and contact you as needed.<br><br>

                                            For more details, please review our Refund Policy.<br><br>

                                            kind and without any endorsement. We shall have no liability whatsoever
                                            arising from or relating to your use of optional third-party tools.<br>
                                            Any use by you of the optional tools offered through the site is entirely at
                                            your own risk and discretion and you should ensure that you are familiar

                                            third-party provider(s).<br>
                                            We may also, in the future, offer new Services and/or features through the
                                            website (including the release of new tools and resources). Such new
                                            features and/or Services shall also be subject to these Terms of
                                            Service.<br><br>

                                            permitted by law.<br><br>

                                            reference, or your violation of any law or the rights of a

                                            SECTION 15 - SEVERABILITY<br><br>
                                            In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to
                                            be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be
                                            enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the
                                            unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of
                                            Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and
                                            enforce-ability of any other remaining provisions.<br><br>

                                            SECTION 16 - TERMINATION<br><br>

                                            termination date shall survive the termination of this agreement for all
                                            purposes.<br>
                                            These Terms of Service are effective unless and until terminated by either
                                            you or us. You may terminate these Terms of Service at any time by notifying
                                            us that you no longer wish to use our Services, or when you cease using our
                                            site.<br>
                                            If in our sole judgment you fail, or we suspect that you have failed, to
                                            comply with any term or provision of these Terms of Service, we also may
                                            terminate this agreement at any time without notice and you will remain
                                            liable for all amounts due up to and including the date of termination;
                                            and/or accordingly may deny you access to our Services (or any part
                                            thereof).<br><br>

                                            SECTION 17 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT<br><br>
                                            The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these
                                            Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or

                                            These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by us on
